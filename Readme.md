## The mathematical behind the model

The core of the ONDC Defensive AI system leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sequence classification. This implementation specifically uses the TFBertForSequenceClassification model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned to classify supply chain issues based on textual descriptions.

### Mathematical Formulation

## Model Details

### AI Model: BERT for Sequence Classification

The core of the ONDC Defensive AI system leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sequence classification. This implementation specifically uses the `TFBertForSequenceClassification` model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is fine-tuned to classify supply chain issues based on textual descriptions.

### Mathematical Formulation

#### 1. Tokenization

The input text is segmented into tokens using the BERT tokenizer:

```python
tokens = BertTokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='tf', truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)
```

### 2. Embedding

The tokens are processed by the BERT model to generate vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning:

```python
embeddings = BERT(tokens)
```

### 3. Classification

The embeddings are fed into a fully-connected layer (DenseLayer) to compute logits (unnormalized scores) for each class (issue detected or not detected). Finally, a softmax activation function converts these logits into probabilities:

```python
logits = DenseLayer(embeddings)
probabilities = softmax(logits)
```

**Mathematical Notation:**

- \( x \): Input text sequence
- \( T \): BERT tokenizer function
- \( E \): BERT model
- \( W \): Weight matrix of the DenseLayer
- \( b \): Bias vector of the DenseLayer
- \( \sigma(z) \): Sigmoid activation function

The logits and probabilities can be expressed as:

\[ \text{logits} = W \cdot E(T(x)) + b \]

\[ \text{probabilities} = \sigma(\text{logits}) \]

### 4. Prediction

The class with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction:

```python
predicted_class = argmax(probabilities)
```

### 5. Probability Threshold Adjustment

Buyers can adjust the threshold (\( \tau \)) for issue detection. Only if the probability of an issue (\( P(\text{issue}) \)) exceeds the threshold is an issue flagged:

```python
issue_detected = { "Yes" if P(issue) >= τ else "No" }
```

### Probability Distribution

We use the gamma distribution to model delivery times and predict delay probabilities.

#### Fit Gamma Distribution:

```python
shape, loc, scale = gamma.fit(delivery_times, floc=0)
```

#### Calculate Probability Density Function (PDF):
```python
y = gamma.pdf(x, shape, loc, scale)
```

#### Calculate Delay Probability using Poisson Distribution:
```python
delay_probability = poisson.cdf(mean_delivery_time + 2, mean_delivery_time)
```

### Additional Considerations

While the provided code snippet focuses on the BERT-based classification, the text mentions the use of gamma and Poisson distributions. These distributions could be employed for separate tasks like:

**Delivery Time Modeling**: The gamma distribution might be used to model the probability density function (PDF) of delivery times, allowing for the calculation of delay probabilities.

**Optional Mathematical Notation:**

- \( t \): Delivery time
- \( \alpha \): Shape parameter of the gamma distribution
- \( \beta \): Scale parameter of the gamma distribution

The PDF of the gamma distribution can be expressed as:

\[ f(t; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{t^{\alpha-1} \cdot e^{-t/\beta}}{\beta^\alpha \cdot \Gamma(\alpha)} \]

where \( \Gamma(\alpha) \) is the gamma function.
